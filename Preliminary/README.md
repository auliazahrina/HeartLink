We initially used a set of preliminary classifiers to model our data: decision tree, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks, and Naive Bayes. 
Here we present the code for decision trees and SVM. We will update with the other classifies.

As the project developed and changed, we utlimately decided to proceed with the best of these classifiers (Naive Bayes) and compare it with more complicated ensemble learners.
